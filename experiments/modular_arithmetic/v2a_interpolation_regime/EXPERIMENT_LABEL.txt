EXPERIMENT: v2a_interpolation_regime
STATUS: Invalid for grokking study (controlled negative result)
DATE: 2026-02-03

CONFIGURATION:
- Split: 55% train / 45% test (RANDOM split)
- Steps: 25,000 (sanity check only)
- Seed: 42

FAILURE MODE:
Random split with reduced coverage (55%) does NOT create algorithmic hardness.
It preserves full operand and result coverage, allowing pure interpolation.

OBSERVED BEHAVIOR:
- Grokking transition: step 19,400 (FASTER than v1 at 33,700)
- Representation rank: 5 → 28 (EXPANDED instead of collapsing)
- Test accuracy: 90%+ at 19.4k steps (violated green light criteria)

ROOT CAUSE:
Reduced coverage creates implicit regularization, accelerating transition
to algorithmic solutions rather than delaying it.

EVIDENCE VALUE:
Demonstrates that random splits do not create constraint conflict.
Preserved as negative control for comparison with structured splits.

DO NOT USE THIS EXPERIMENT FOR GROKKING ANALYSIS.
